This is an open sourced visual tutorial on how to configure a newly registered [OnlyDomains](https://www.onlydomains.com) domain to use [Cloudflare DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/dns/) and how to deploy [Industrial Empathy 11ty template](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/eleventy-high-performance-blog/) serverless via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) delivered at the Edge on [CloudFlare CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/cdn/).

This blog template is based on [eleventy-high-performance-blog-plus](https://github.com/0-vortex/eleventy-high-performance-blog-plus) which is based on [eleventy-high-performance-blog](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/eleventy-high-performance-blog/) which itself is based on [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).

You can find all the terribly messy commits for this demo on [github](https://github.com/0-vortex/eleventy-high-performance-blog-plus/commits/main) and all the images used throughout this blog on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/0-vortex/8c1147b957f88b7ceaa85d3b22843803). You can also find some of my other work over at [github:0-vortex](https://github.com/0-vortex).
