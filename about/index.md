This is an open sourced visual tutorial on how to:
- register and setup a new domain using [OnlyDomains](https://www.onlydomains.com)
- host unlimited number of subdomains using [Cloudflare DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/dns/)
- configure 11ty using [Industrial Empathy](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/eleventy-high-performance-blog/) template
- deploy serverless via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- host content as code using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- deliver at edge using [CloudFlare CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/cdn/)
- edit markdown content using [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org)

This blog template is based on [eleventy-high-performance-blog-plus](https://github.com/0-vortex/eleventy-high-performance-blog-plus) an example repository implementation of [eleventy-high-performance-blog](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/eleventy-high-performance-blog/) which is based on [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog).

You can find all the terribly messy commits for this demo on [github](https://github.com/0-vortex/eleventy-high-performance-blog-plus/commits/main) and all the images used throughout this blog on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/0-vortex/8c1147b957f88b7ceaa85d3b22843803). You can also find some of my other work over at [github:0-vortex](https://github.com/0-vortex).
